# Lesson control assessment (`crml_assessment: "1.0"`)
#
# Goal
# ----
# Provide a simple “org posture” input for lesson portfolios.
#
# Notes
# -----
# - We use SCF CMM levels for posture (0..5).
# - We also specify `affects` to demonstrate that some controls are intended to
#   reduce frequency vs severity.
# - The reference engine maps SCF CMM levels to an effectiveness value during
#   portfolio planning.

      notes: "Training exists, but completion and reinforcement are inconsistent."

      notes: "EDR telemetry and response playbooks reduce dwell time and impact."
