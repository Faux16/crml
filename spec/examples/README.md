# CRML Examples

This directory contains example CRML 1.0 models:

- `qber-enterprise.yaml` — QBER-style hierarchical Bayesian model with
  entropy-based Criticality Index, mixture severity, Gaussian copula, and
  MCMC + Monte Carlo pipeline.

- `fair-baseline.yaml` — Simple FAIR-like model using Poisson frequency and
  Lognormal severity with pure Monte Carlo simulation.
