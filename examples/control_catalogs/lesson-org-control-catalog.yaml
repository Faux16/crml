# Lesson control catalog (`crml_control_catalog: "1.0"`)
#
# Goal
# ----
# Provide a small, realistic *internal* control catalog for the lesson series.
#
# Why a lesson-specific catalog?
# - The repo already contains examples/control_catalogs/control-catalog.yaml, but it is intentionally tiny.
# - For lessons we want a few controls that map cleanly to CIS v8 and show different mitigation surfaces.
