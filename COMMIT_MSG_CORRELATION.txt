Feat: Asset Correlation & System Documentation (Phase 2 Complete)

Significantly advances the risk engine's capabilities by introducing dependency modeling (Common Mode Failures) and finalizing system architecture documentation.

**1. Engine & Math**
- **Asset Correlation**: Implemented Gaussian Copula logic (`engine.py`) to model dependencies between assets.
- **Correlated Sampling**: Updated `FrequencyEngine` to accept correlated uniforms and use Inverse Transform Sampling (PPF).
- **Dependency**: Added `scipy` to `pyproject.toml` for efficient statistical functions.
- **Schema**: Updated `CRMLSchema` to support a `correlations` matrix in the model definition.

**2. Frontend / UI**
- **Visualization**: Added "Correlated Risks Active" card to `SimulationResults.tsx` to explicitly show when dependency assumptions are active.
- **Metadata**: Updated `result_model.py` and `engine.py` to pass correlation metadata to the frontend.

**3. Documentation**
- **Architecture**: Added `docs/architecture.md` with Mermaid diagrams illustrating the full Simulation Engine flow.
- **Developer Guide**: Added `docs/howto/add-new-distribution.md` to guide future extensions.

**4. Verification**
- **Unit Tests**: Added `tests/test_correlation.py` verifying statistical properties (Pearson correlation > 0.9 for high-corr inputs).
- **Example**: Added `spec/examples/correlation-example.yaml`.
- **Comparison**: Validated that correlation increases VaR (Tail Risk) while preserving EAL.
