# Lesson 04 — CIS posture assessment
#
# What this lesson teaches
# ------------------------
# - A portfolio can assess CIS controls directly.
# - This makes CIS-authored scenarios executable without any translation layer.
#
# Notes
# -----
# - This is *not* a real benchmark posture.
# - SCF CMM levels are used for demonstration (0..5).
