# Language installation (`crml_lang`)

Canonical installation instructions live here:

- [Installation](../Installation.md)

Install the language package:

```bash
pip install crml-lang
```

Optional extras:

- Excel mapping support: `pip install "crml-lang[xlsx]"`

This package does **not** provide the `crml` simulation CLI; that comes from `crml-engine`.
