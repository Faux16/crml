# Lesson 03 — Phishing variant (scenario-scoped control factors)
#
# What this lesson teaches
# ------------------------
# - Scenario-scoped factors can change between scenarios even when the org posture
#   is identical.
# - In this variant we assume a more sophisticated campaign where:
#   - MFA is less protective (e.g. prompt-bombing, session token theft)
#   - awareness training is less protective (more targeted pretext)
#
# This scenario is designed to be run with the same org assessment as Lesson 02.

    Variant of Lesson 02 with different `effectiveness_against_threat` factors.

    Use this to understand the separation between:
    - org posture (portfolio assessment)
    - scenario threat assumptions (this file)

      notes: "Still helps against some spoofing but not against lookalike domains." 

    - id: "org:awareness.security"
      effectiveness_against_threat: 0.20
      notes: "More targeted campaign reduces training effectiveness."

      notes: "EDR still helps contain fallout once the incident is detected."
